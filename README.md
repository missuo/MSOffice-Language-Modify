# MSOffice-Language-Modify
Modify MSOffice language on macOS

## Background
Microsoft Office on macOS does not provide the option to modify the language, so we can only modify its display language through the command line, which is not very convenient.

## Features
- Chinese language support
- English language support
- Customized language support
- Support for viewing current language

## Usage
~~~shell
bash <(curl -Ls https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/missuo/MSOffice-Language-Modify/msoffice.sh)
~~~

## About custom languages
You should first find the language code supported by Microsoft Office. Then enter the language code you found to complete the modification.
